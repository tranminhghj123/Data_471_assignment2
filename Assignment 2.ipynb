    "- Cite all references outside of the course you used, including conversations with other students which were helpful. (This helps us give credit where it is due!). All references must use a commonly accepted reference format, for example, APA or IEEE (or another citation style of your choice). **You may add these as a separate Markdown cell underneath the references that have already been included.**\n",

We will be using a CSV File generated by the <b>City of Edmonton</b> containing Licensed Pets in the city.

This assignment has four (4) parts: PARTS A, B, C, and D.\n",

Thus pets here will have lower chance for actually be SPAYED_OR_NEUTERED. Especially in Armstrong Industrial, with the ratio is 0.0323, which is almost not SPAYED_OR_NEUTERED, this come from the fact that they are big industrial company so animal is rather kept for working rather than pets.
